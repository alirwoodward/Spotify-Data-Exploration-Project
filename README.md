In this semester long Data Programming project, I examined potential trends in music audio features by analyzing data from songs that made the Billboard and ARIA charts from 1960-2023.

Aims and Objectives of the Project:

- Clean the data in order to prepare a suitible and comprehensive dataset for genre classification
- Revisit more specific trends in audio features as a continued exploration of the dataset
- Use the pre-trained deep net, YAMNet, to classify music genres based on each individual song
- Clean the YAMNet generated data so that it is in suitable condition for convenient and applicable future use
- Analyse the generated song generes in comparison to the previously given artist genres
